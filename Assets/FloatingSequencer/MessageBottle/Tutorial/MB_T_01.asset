  _text: 'Welcome to Tide Defense

    Have you ever wondered what happens to message
    bottles thrown into the sea ? They end up here, in this small, anonymous creek
    long forgotten.

    This Sand Castle has been built to store them, but tides
    and waves may cause it''s doom.

    Use what the Sea offers you to protect the
    Sand Castle and it''s content. '
