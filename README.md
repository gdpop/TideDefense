# Tide Defense

## Project

Small relaxing sandbox game. Literaly. 

Built on a forgotten creek, a sand castle holds a library. Throughout the years, the library has gathered many messages sealed inside glass bottles. Casted away a long time ago with no destinary, these bottles tells the story of random people. Passionate love or desperate sorrow, each message is special and as a unique story to tell. Protect the library from the tide and gather more souvenir from distant times. 

Initialy a love project from GDPOP Studio, I keep on the dream of making this game.
